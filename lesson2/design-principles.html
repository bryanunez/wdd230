                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Adobe</p>
                    <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">adobe.com/</a>

                    <p>By using this principle, we try to draw the user's attention to those sections that are relevant and important for the web page's purpose. We do that by using the color, contrast and size of the elements in our web page.</p>
                    <p>In this example, we can see that the nav bar on the top is white and the content below has other colors that inmediatelly grab the user's attention to that area of the web page.</p>
                    <p>The size of the title of that section is bigger than the others and gives a description of what is that area about. Below that title, there are other sections that describe each of the plans offered by Adobe. Each section have a different background color to make contrast and to make the text visible. Also, the title of each od them have a biger font size but not as big as the font in the main title of that section of the page.</p>
                    <p>Each of the sections with the description of each of the plans have an element that grabs aour attention inmediatelly because of the high contrast in the colors. That is the "free trial" button. The "buy now" button doesn't have that contrast in color, because the purpose of that section of the page is to draw the user's attention to that button to have them trying the free trial.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever spent a lot of time trying to decide what to watch on Netflix? Don't you think that this happens because there are a lot options you can chose? A man named William Edmund Hick realized that the more choices a man faces, the more time he would take to make a decision. Web designers have adopted this principle to improve user's experience on websites.</p>
                    <p>In this example, Facebook has simplified its landing page to just two visible options for the user: log in or create an account.</p>
                    <p>Facebook has been one of the most growing websites in the world because of the new users the get every year and they have been using this principle from a long time ago in order to get more users.</p>

                    <p>By using white space correctly we create websites that look more attractive, clean and professional. When designing a website, we must take into consideration what our "white space" patterns would be in order to organize the content on the website</p>
                    <p>If we design those patterns correctly, the content on the website will look organized. In this example, there's a pattern of white space between each of the example gradients which makes the content look clean and organized in the website.</p>
