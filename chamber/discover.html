            <p>Valladolid (Mayan: Saki') is the third most populous city in the state of Yucat√°n. The city was founded on May 28, 1543 by Francisco de Montejo, "El Sobrino". In 1848, the city and its haciendas were invaded by the Maya Indians during the Caste War, so the affected families had to emigrate to other regions; the city was recovered months later by the Yucatecan government. On June 4, 1910, the city was the scene of one of the first antecedents of the Mexican Revolution known as the Valladolid Rebellion or the First Spark of the Revolution. In 2012, the city was incorporated into the list of Mexico's Magical Towns, the second to receive this designation in the state of Yucat√°n, after Izamal.</p>

The proximity to R√≠o Lagartos, the 80 km long estuary that runs parallel to the peninsular coast, today declared a natural reserve of the biosphere, contributes to the recognition of the place and to increase the tourist flow that benefits it.</p>
